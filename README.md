Develop At Ubisoft game programming project

theme: infinite scroller 

First try at game development in C++ using the provided API based on OpenGL
The player needs to play as long as possible while collecting all the boxes and avoiding being hit by the hammers.

While complete and playable, it could still be improved. 
Planning to add a functioning object pooling system to manage the obstacles spawning,
I also still need to solve a few issues about the game sound system.
